#Week 4: dplyr package

#Task: Write the function to get a dataset from Base R: HairEyeColor
#and give the dataset a new name of your choice
dim(HairEyeColor)
ColorData<-as.data.frame(HairEyeColor)

#See the top rows of the data
#TASK: Write the function to see the top rows of the data
tail(ColorData,5)
head(ColorData,5)

#Install and call the package dplyr
#TASK: Write the functions to install and call dplyr
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)


#Let's just see the hair and sex columns
#Task: Write the function to 'select' just the hair and sex columns 
#(hint: use the 'select' function)
select(ColorData,Hair,Sex)

#Let's name the dataset with just the two columns, Hair and Sex
#TASK: Write the function to save the two columns as one new dataset
#and give it a name
HairSex<- select(ColorData,Hair,Sex)

#Let's get rid of the Sex column in the new dataset created above
#TASK: Write the function that deselects the sex column
#(hint: use the 'select' function to not select a -column)
select(HairSex,-Sex)

#Let's rename a column name
#TASK: Write the function that renames 'sex' to 'gender'
rename(HairSex,gender=Sex)

#Let's make a new dataset with the new column name
#TASK: Write the function that names a new dataset that includes the 'gender' column
HairSex1 = rename(HairSex, gender=Sex)

#Let's 'filter' just the females from our dataset
#TASK: Write the function that includes only rows that are 'female'
Females<-filter(HairSex1,gender=='Female')

#Let's 'group' our data by gender
#TASK: Write the function to group the data by gender (hint: group_by)
group_by(HairSex1,gender)

#Let's see how many students were examined in the dataset (total the frequency)
#TASK: replace 'datasetname' with the name of your dataset and get the total
#TASK: After you run it, write the total here:_592__
total=mutate(datasetname, total=cumsum(Freq))
total=mutate(ColorData, total=cumsum(Freq))


#Since we have a females dataset, let's make a males dataset
#TASK: Write the function that includes only rows that are 'male'
Males<-filter(HairSex1, gender=='Male')

#And now let's join the males and females
#TASK: Write the function that joins the male and female rows 
#(hint: try using 'union' or 'bind_rows')
HairSex1<-bind_rows(Males,Females)

#Optional Task: add any of the other functions 
#you learned about from the dplyr package
